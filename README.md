# Super Duper Script Editor 1's Sidekick (aka SDSE1's Sidekick)
With this tool you'll be able to check how much your translation has
progressed and which files are yet to be translated.

Keep in mind that it works only with the "Super Duper Script Editor 1",
so if you are not using the SDSE1, the SDSE1's Sidekick is not useful to you.
